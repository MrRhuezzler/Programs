# In the game of Scrabbleâ„¢, each letter has points associated with it. The total score
# of a word is the sum of the scores of its letters. More common letters are worth fewer
# points while less common letters are worth more points. The points associated with
# each letter are shown below:
# a. One point A, E, I, L, N, O, R, S, T and U
# b. Two points D and G
# c. Three points B, C, M and P
# d. Four points F, H, V, W and Y
# e. Five points K
# f. Eight points J and X
# g. Ten points Q and Z
# Create a dictionary with the alphabet as the key and the point as the value. Also
# try the other way, Point as the key and the alphabets as the value. Get an
# alphabet from the user and print the corresponding value and given a point value,
# print the alphabets having that point value.
